## My process

### Built with

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

It is wayyyy easier to start mobile first and then handle bigger screens. This is also the first personal project of
mine in react and tailwind, so I learned a lot about the setup and configuration for them.
